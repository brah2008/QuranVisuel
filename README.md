Creating an animation video related to the Quran using Python would require a significant amount of effort and expertise in both programming and animation. Here is a basic outline of the steps you could follow:

**Research and Script Writing: Start by researching the specific story or verse from the Quran that you want to animate, and write a script that encapsulates the essence of the story or verse.**

**Character Design:** Design the characters that will be used in the animation, such as the Prophet, his companions, or other relevant figures.

**Animation:** Use a library such as Matplotlib or Pygame to create the animation. You'll need to write code to control the movement, appearance, and behavior of the characters, as well as to generate backgrounds, environments, and other visual elements.

**Sound and Music:** Integrate background music and sound effects into the animation using libraries such as Pygame or Pyglet.

This code creates an animation of a ball that bounces up and down. The ball is represented by a circle marker, and the animation is controlled by the animate function, which updates the position of the marker over time. The FuncAnimation class is used to control the animation, and the animation is displayed in a window using the plt.show() command.
